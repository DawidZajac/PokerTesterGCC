The order below must be followed to ensure proper operation of the Program
1. Bots read the configuration file and load the game settings
2. Bots create their own txt files in the userpath directory, as per the configuration file. (name of file is now bot identifier)
3. The Bots await for the tester to begin- this will happen when data is written to their txt files
4. The tester is then started.
5. Tester waits for user to input the path to the configuration file( The default path "./simulationFiles/config/config.txt" is selected if user presses the return key)
6. The tester loads the configuration, and initializes its data structure, loading in the player files
7. The tester waits for the user to initialize the simulation, by pressing any key
8. Tester writes the card data into the Bot's txt files, and writes the state of the game to the appropriate PlayAreaFile ( First play area file is odd, and it switches between odd and even every new hand)
9. The tester than awaits for the bots, in order, to write their decision to their txt file (f for fold, c for check/call, r for raise)
10. Tester checks if decision was legal, and writes the outcome to the playArea file (no response within time limit = auto fold)
11. The time limit is as set in the configuration file, with each decision having incrementally more time allocated (pre-flop=1/4 of the time, post flop 1/2 etc)
12. After the betting round, the board cards are revealed (3 for flop, 1 for each turn and river) and announced in the playArea file
13. Steps 9-12 are repeated for all stages of the game
14. If the game goes to Showdown, the result is declared in the PlayArea file
15. The Tester prepares to write to the other PlayAreaFile
16. The player Pots are backed up every so often, as specified by the configuration file
17. Steps 8-16 repeat until the end of the simulation.
